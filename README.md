# GoSorter

GoSorter is a golang implementation of a command line tool to sort lines in files.
It is largely inspired in the ["sort"](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html) linux command, but implemented in Golang. Also the functionality is not exactly the same (only some features are implemented at the moment).

*Important*: This tool doesn't support binary files at the moment.
