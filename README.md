# GoSorter

GoSorter is a golang implementation of a command line tool to sort lines in files.
It is largely inspired in the ["sort"](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html) linux command, but implemented in Golang. Also the functionality is not exactly the same (only some features are implemented at the moment).

*Important*: This tool doesn't support binary files at the moment.

# Important

⚠️ This tool was developed very quickly and just for fun :). It is **NOT** battle tested. So please use it carefully and at your own risk!

# Getting started

- Just install this tool: `go install github.com/avazquezcode/gosorter@latest`

- Execute: `gosorter sort <FILE_PATH>`

- To check the different flags (options) you can use, please run `gosorter sort --help`
